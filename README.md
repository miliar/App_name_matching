Building a crosswalk which matches Apple apps to their Google Play counterparts. 
Dataset 1 consists of 500 rows with columns [platform  app_id  app_name  publisher_name  categories],
Dataset 2 shows the matching pairs of Dataset 1. Dataset 3 is the test-dataset, with the same shape as Dataset 1,
for which the model will make predictions.
